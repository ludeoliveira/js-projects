## Reviews 

There is an JavaScript array with objects wich contains a collection of informations about various persons. 

These informations are rendered out as we click on one of the arrows, showing us the previous or the next person data collection.

We also have a *show random person* button wich will choose randomly a person from the array and render out their information on the screen.
