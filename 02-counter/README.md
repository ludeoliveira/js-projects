## Counter

There is a counter set to 0 as its inicial value, and three buttons: *decrease*, *reset* and *increase*.

When the *decrease* button is clicked, the counter will decrease by one. When the *increase* button is clicked, the counter will increase by one. The *reset* button set the counter's value back to zero. The counter changes its color. If the value is above zero, the color of the counter is going to be green, when it is less than zero, the color of the counter is red and black if the conter is reseted.
